                <p><em>Stay at Home Mom</em></p>
                <p>I am currently a stay at home mom to two children. I completed my undergrad work at Angelo State
                    University with a degree in Business Marketing. I worked most of my time at <a
                        href="https://www.enterprise.com/en/home.html">Enterprise Rent A Car</a>,
                    as a State of Texas Representative and <a href="https://www.truecar.com/">True Car</a>, as an
                    Onboarding
                    Specialist. It was not until I stayed
                    at home with my two kids for four years that I have decided to pursue a career in coding.
